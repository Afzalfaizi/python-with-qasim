# Python Learning Journey

This repository contains my progression through various Python programming concepts, from basics to advanced topics. Each directory represents different learning modules and concepts in Python programming.

## Project Structure

### Core Learning Modules
- `class_01/` - Introduction to Python basics
- `class_02/` - Fundamentals continued
- `class_04/` - Python programming concepts
- `class_07/` - Intermediate concepts
- `class_08/` - Dictionaries and data structures
- `class_09/` - Loops and iterations
- `class_10/` - Functions and Lambda expressions
- `oop/` - Object-Oriented Programming concepts

## Latest Work
The most recent work is in the `oop/` directory, which includes:
- Basic class implementations
- Object creation and manipulation
- Method definitions and usage

## Development Setup
- Python virtual environment (`.venv/`)
- VS Code configuration (`.vscode/`)
- Git version control

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository
2. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On Unix or MacOS
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. Navigate through directories based on the concept you want to learn

## Topics Covered
- Basic Python syntax
- Control structures
- Data structures (Dictionaries)
- Loops and iterations
- Functions and Lambda expressions
- Object-Oriented Programming
