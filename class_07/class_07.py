# Dictionaries in Python
# A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. 
# It is mutable, meaning it can be changed after it's created.
# It is unordered, meaning the order of the key-value pairs is not guaranteed. 

from typing import Dict, Union, Optional
import pprint

value = Union[int, str, dict, set, tuple]
